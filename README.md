# Overview

This project aims to provide a way for members of the RLBot community to contribute
their ideas to a common set of tools for arithmetic, simulation, and car controllers.

## Build and Test

To build, you need a copy of 64 bit python and a C++ compiler (assuming Windows only)

Get a copy of the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/samuelpmish/Utilities
```

Run the build script to download submodules and build the C++ tools and their python bindings

```
cd Utilities
./build.sh
```
